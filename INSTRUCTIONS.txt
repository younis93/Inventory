Since I do not have access to run 'npm' or 'node' in this environment, I cannot start the application for you.

Please follow these steps to run the application on your machine:

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    cd "C:\Users\HP\Desktop\Code APP"
3.  Install the dependencies:
    npm install
4.  Start the development server:
    npm run dev

Once the server starts, open your browser and go to the URL shown (usually http://localhost:5173).
